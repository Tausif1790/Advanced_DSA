1. In-order predecessor of the node with value 50 is the rightmost node in its left subtree. So, it is 40.
2. In-order predecessor of the node with value 150 is the rightmost node in its left subtree. So, it is 130.
3. In-order predecessor of the node with value 30 is the rightmost node in its left subtree. So, it is 20.

Therefore:
In-order predecessor of 50 is 40.
In-order predecessor of 150 is 130.
In-order predecessor of 30 is 20.
