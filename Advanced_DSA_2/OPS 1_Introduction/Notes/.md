packages 
A package in Java is a way to organize related classes, interfaces, and resources into a single unit. It provides a hierarchical structure to the codebase, which aids in better code management and avoids naming conflicts.
 In C#, the equivalent of a Java package is a namespace. Both packages and namespaces provide a way to organize related classes and avoid naming conflicts. However, there are some differences between the two. For example, while Java packages can be spread across multiple files, C# namespaces are defined within a single file. Additionally, C# namespaces can be nested, whereas Java packages cannot.



 In C#, access modifiers are used to control the visibility and accessibility of types and type members 1234. The following table summarizes the accessibility of access modifiers in C#:

Access Modifier
Accessible in Same Class	    Accessible in Derived Class 
Accessible in Same Assembly	    Accessible in Different Assembly
Public	        Yes 	Yes	        Yes	    Yes
Protected	    Yes 	Yes	        No	    No
Internal	    Yes 	No/Yes	    Yes	    No
Private	        Yes	    No	        No	    No

Here is what each column represents:

Accessible in Same Class: The access modifier can be accessed within the same class.
Accessible in Derived Class: The access modifier can be accessed within a derived class.
Accessible in Same Assembly: The access modifier can be accessed within the same assembly.
Accessible in Different Assembly: The access modifier can be accessed in a different assembly.
