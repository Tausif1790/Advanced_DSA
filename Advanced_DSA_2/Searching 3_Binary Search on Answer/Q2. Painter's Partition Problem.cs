Problem Description
Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integers C of size N. Element C[i] represents the length of ith board.
You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1]. There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of the board.
Calculate and return the minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of the board.
NOT
1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards. This means a configuration where painter 1 paints boards 1 and 3 but not 2 is invalid.
Return the ans % 10000003.

Input 1:
 A = 2
 B = 5
 C = [1, 10]
Input 2:
 A = 10
 B = 1
 C = [1, 8, 11, 3]

Output 1: 50
Output 2: 11

/*
Certainly! The line ans = (midTimeReq * B) % mod;
 calculates the total time required to paint all boards by a single painter
  within a certain time limit (midTimeReq).
 It takes into account that each painter needs B units of time to paint 1 unit of the board.
  The result is then taken modulo mod to keep it within the specified range.
   The variable ans holds this total time, and it is used in the binary search
    to find the minimum time required to paint all boards with the given number of painters.
